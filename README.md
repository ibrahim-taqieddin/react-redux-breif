# react-redux-breif
In this project, we developed an entertainment web application that provide the user with different choices of world-cup soccer. 
Our Website is fully RESPONSIVE, and we used the following technologies: 

1- Required Technologies: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (including ES5, ES6), React Redux, and Hooks. 
2-We have used a predefined (external) API that is related to our project idea and returns random results.

Our Web Application Components: 

1- landing page which contains:

Header and navbar
top rated section (Image slider)
grid for randomly selected items
other sections related to your idea
footer

2- Reviews Page:

users can comment on the posted reviews.
the comment component must have a profile avatar, fname, time of the comment
the comments can be edited and deleted
​


3- Data storage:

we have saved the posts and comments in a database.

we didn't  lose the data after refreshing the page.


4- Register, and log in:

5- the static pages (About us, contact us, ...etc.).

6- profile page :

It contains the user information + his own posts + favorites
